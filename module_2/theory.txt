
1) How memory is managed in Python? 

->	Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of
 this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.

2)  What is the purpose continue statement in python? 

->     The continue statement in Python is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration only.

3) What are negative indexes and why are they used? 

->   Negative indexing is used in Python to manipulate sequence objects such as lists, arrays, strings, etc. Negative 
 indexing retrieves elements from the end by providing negative numbers as sequence indexes.

1) B1.What is Python ,Name some of the features of Python.
 
	Python can be used to develop both desktop and web apps and complex scientific and numerical applications. Python's 
 data analysis features help you create custom big data solutions without so much time and effort. You can also use the 
 Python data visualization libraries and APIs to present data in a more appealing way.

	
2) Is python the right choice for Web based Programming? 

	Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development. It is
  a high-level language that can be used to write complex applications with minimal coding. Python's versatility also makes
  it ideal for developing machine learning models and scientific computing.

3) Why was the language called as Python?

	The Python programming language was named after the British comedy group Monty Python because its creator, Guido van
  Rossum, was a fan of their work and found the name unique and suitable for his new language.

4)What is the language from which Python has got its features or derived its features? 

	Python has derived features and inspiration from languages like ABC, Modula-3, C, Perl, Lisp, and Smalltalk, among 
  others, but it has also introduced its own unique features and design choices that make it a distinct and widely used
  programming language.

5) Does python support switch or case statement in Python?If not what is the reason for the same?

	In short, Python does not have a built-in `switch` or `case` statement because of its focus on simplicity and 
 readability. Instead, you can achieve similar functionality using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements or by using
 dictionaries to map input values to corresponding actions or functions.

6)How Python is interpreted?

	In short, Python is interpreted by first converting the source code into an intermediate form called bytecode.
  The Python interpreter then executes this bytecode line by line, managing variable types and memory allocation dynamically
  as the code runs. This interpretation process allows for rapid development and easy debugging.

7)How memory is managed in Python?

	Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The
  management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.

 
8)What is namespace in Python?

	a namespace in Python is a container that holds a collection of names (identifiers) and their associated objects. 
 It helps organize and manage the scope and visibility of variables, functions, classes, and modules in your code. Python
 has various types of namespaces, including local, global, built-in, and module namespaces, which determine where identifiers
 are accessible and how they avoid naming conflicts.

9)What is the purpose continue statement in python?

   the `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. 
 It allows you to bypass specific code within the loop based on conditions, enabling you to control the flow of your loop.

10) What are the tools that help to find bugs or perform static analysis?

	Pychecker and Pylint are the static analysis tools that help to find bugs in python. Pychecker is an opensource
  tool for static analysis that detects the bugs from source code and warns about the style and complexity of the bug

11) What are Python decorators?

	A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without
 modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

12) .What is PEP 8?
	The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code. PEP stands for Python 
 Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python 
 and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.
