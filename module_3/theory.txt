1)  What is List? How will you reverse a list? 

	A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered 
 sequence of elements. Reverse Array using the reversed() and reverse() built-in function.
 Using reversed() we can reverse the list and a list_reverseiterator object is created, 
 from which we can create a list using list() type casting. Or, we can also use the list 
 reverse() function to reverse list in place.

2) Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 

	The append() method in the Python programming language adds an item to a list that
  already exists whereas the extend() method adds each of the iterable elements which is 
  supplied as a parameter to the end of the original list.

3) How will you compare two lists? 

	sort() method sorts the two lists and the == operator compares the two lists item
  by item which means they have equal data items at equal positions. This checks if the 
  list contains equal data item values but it does not take into account the order of 
  elements in the list.23-Aug-2023

4) What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

    A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the
    elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.

      The key difference between tuples and lists is that while tuples are immutable objects, lists are
      mutable.
